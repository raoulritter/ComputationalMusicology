# ComputationalMusicology


For the subject Computational Musicology we have to choose a corpus that we can then analyse using the Spotify API. 

For my corpus I will be looking at the 7 (solo) studio albums by Kanye West that he created after the death of his mother. 
Online there is often a theory that these albums correspond with the stages of grief.
