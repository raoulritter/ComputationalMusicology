# ComputationalMusicology


For the subject Computational Musicology we have to choose a corpus that we can then analyse using the Spotify API. 

For my corpus I will be looking at the 7 (solo) studio albums by Kanye West that he created after the death of his mother. 
Online there is often a theory that these albums correspond with the stages of grief. 
During this assignment I would like to check if these albums indeed follow this pattern.

1. Shock (808â€™s and Heartbreak)
2. Denial (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)
3. Anger (Yeezus)
4. Bargaining (The Life of Pablo)
5. Depression (Ye)
6. Testing (JESUS IS KING)
7. Acceptance (DONDA)

I would like to do this analysis by taking a look at the information that the spotify API provides such as valence, tempo and speechiness in order to analyse if these albums indeed could be catagorized as having differentes that could be recognized as corresponding to the stages of grief.
